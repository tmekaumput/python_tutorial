# Python Tutorial
This tutorial is aimed to practice core functions of Python. The project is created using PyCharm and organising the packages in the easy to follow steps.

# Fundamental

## Get Started - package 01_get_started
### hello_world.py
Starts off with classic hello world application, using print function.

### hello_function.py
Python runs on an interpreter system, however it can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.
In Python a function is defined using the def keyword with parenthesis and optional parameters terminated with : at the end. 

Python interpreter relies heavily on indentations to indicate a block of code as we can see from the implementation of my_function.
This rule is also applied to conditional statements and loops which is very important as you may find yourself in trouble trying to fix bug or error caused by incorrect indentations.

### comments.py
Python uses hash sign (#) to begin a comment. All characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the comment

### quotation.py
Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.

### user_input.py
Some basic built-in function provided in order to interact with user.

### multiline_statement.py
It uses backslash (\) to denote that the line should continue

### multiple_statement_singleline.py
The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single line given that neither statement starts a new code block.

## Variables - package 02_variables
### variable_declaration.py
Python does not require you to declare variable explicitly. It happens automatically when assigning value to variable using = operator with the value on the right hand.

### multiple_assignment.py
Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously. The sample demonstrates that all three variables are assigned to the same memory location (pointer).
The del function is used to delete the reference pointer.

### numerical_types.py
Python supports four numerical data type below. The type can be defined explicitly for Long and Complex.  
- int (signed integers)
- long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal)
- float (floating point real values)
- complex (complex numbers)

### list_type.py
A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]) similar to arrays in other languages. However, all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.
The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.

### string_type.py
Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Technically, a String can be considered as a list of characters.
Python allows us to use the same operators as list, such as [], [:], +, *  

## Operators - package 03_operators
### arithmetic_operators.py
Python supports these arithmetic operators, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponent, floor division

### comparison_operators.py
Python supports these comparison operators, ==, !=, <>, >, <, >=, <=

### assignment_operators.py
Python supports these assignment operators, =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=

### membership_operators.py
Pythonâ€™s membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples.

### identity_operator.py
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects.
